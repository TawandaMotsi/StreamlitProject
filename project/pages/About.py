    ðŸ‘‹ **Hello!**  
    Iâ€™m **Tawanda Motsi** â€” a technically minded and goal-oriented professional with a unique background in both **Irrigation Engineering** and **Computer Engineering**.

    I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Irrigation Engineering from **Chinhoyi University of Technology** in Zimbabwe and Iâ€™m currently completing my BSc in **Software Engineering** at the **Technological University of the Shannon**. My diverse experience includes designing and installing micro, overhead, and surface irrigation systems, along with pump selection and water system planning.

    More recently, Iâ€™ve been expanding my focus to include **software development**, **data analysis**, and **programming**, with strong proficiency in **Java** and growing experience in building full-stack applications.

    This web application showcases my ability to collect, clean, process, analyse, and visualise data, blending technical skill with practical insight.
